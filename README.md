Exploring R packages

## Package title
ggplot2 

## Location
ggplot2 package can be installed from both CRAN and GitHub. The CRAN location is https://cloud.r-project.org/package=ggplot2 and GitHub location is https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/

## Vignette(s)
There are 3 formal vignettes of ggplot2. These are-

Extending ggplot2: it teaches how to extend ggplot2 by creating a new stat, geom, or theme.

Using ggplot2 in packages: This is intended for package developers who use ggplot2 within their package code.

Aesthetic specifications: This vignette summarises the various formats that grid drawing functions take. Most of this information is available scattered throughout the R documentation. This appendix brings it all together in one place.

## Application(s)
Ggplot2 is widely used to make high quality data visualization for websites and research articles, analyze and plot ones Twitter use, plot the frequency of twitter hashtag usage over time, and so forth.

## Review
ggplot2 is a plotting package that makes it simple to create complex plots from data in a data frame. It provides a more programmatic interface for specifying what variables to plot, how they are displayed, and general visual properties. Therefore, we only need minimal changes if the underlying data change or if we decide to change from a bar plot to a scatterplot. This helps in creating publication quality plots with minimal amounts of adjustments and tweaking. As a beginner programmer I find this packages very useful while creating plots. This package was not very hard learn, but it has wide range of features which needs time to explore.
